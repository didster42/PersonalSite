                        One of the things I put on my to-do list for 2021 was writing more. 
                        I had been thinking about doing something like this for quite some time 
                        for a few reasons
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            I felt that it would be cool to write about my experiences
                            and document them to look back at them in the future.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I thought it would allow me to learn to articulate things better
                            and to organize my thoughts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I googled reasons to start a blog because I couldn't think of anything to write,
                            which adds to why I should start writing more.
                        </li>
                        
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="postPara">
                    Now that I have reserved a corner for myself on the internet,
                    the next challenge is actually to write something.
